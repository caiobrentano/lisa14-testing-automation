# Testing Your Automation Code

This is a hands-on tutorial that will cover the basics that everyone needs to know about how to test your automation code. Weâ€™ll start off with a quick introduction to Chef and work our way through writing a fully-tested cookbook or two using linting, unit testing, integration testing, and cross-platform testing.

Hands-on exercises throughout the tutorial will reinforce the material discussed.
